# Computes the waypoints on a path composed only of orthogonal
# linear segments between the 2 tiles on the "waypoints" layer
# with properties "spawn_point" and "leave_point", and moving
# along the path tiles on the "path" layer

# This allows you to place 2 tiles with the correct properties
# on the map, draw some path between them (made up of only
# horizontal or vertical segments), and get a list of cell
# row,col pairs to use as waypoints for creeps traveling
# along the path

# You draw it, we give you the numbers

# Note loops in path will kill this script, and ambiguous paths
# can lead to strange results
